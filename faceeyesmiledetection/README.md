### Haar Cascade 

Object Detection using [Haar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature) feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

### Getting Started
